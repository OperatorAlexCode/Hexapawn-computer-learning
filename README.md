# Hexapawn-computer-learning
Hexapawn is a two player game invented by Martin gardener which's played on a *N*x*M* board which was invented to show that an Heuristic AI implimented by a mechanical computer could play it.

This application was a test to see if I could make this.

A shoutout to Vsauce2 for the idea in a video of his.
